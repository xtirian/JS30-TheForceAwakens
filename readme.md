## Overview

Just to explain some details, I'm seeing this more as challenges than classes. At this moment I don't know so much of javascript, but I know enough to explore by myself the documentation and try some solutions.

So, you could see my codes and notice that some times is totally different from the originals, mainly because I see the begin of the videos to see what propose is, try to make alone and then I see the complete video. Sometimes, this makes me waste more time that it should, but it make me feel better trying to reach the solutions alone.

I'll avoid to change my original code after I see the videos, but if I see that the professor gave some hint that is the trully nectar of JS life, I'll change my code. So if you see some notes like "professor hint" its because I did it work, but I changed at some point.
